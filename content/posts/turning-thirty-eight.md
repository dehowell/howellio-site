Today is my thirty-eighth birthday. We went out for a family birthday breakfast at my favorite place in Burlington, took a walk together, and now I'm getting some quiet time at my desk while listening to soothing, droning music (hello, [A Winged Victory for the Sullen](https://www.awvfts.com)!)

This time of year, I like to take stock of things and think about habits and goals for the year head. Other folks can have their New Year's Resolutions and all, but for me I need a little space from the holidays before I can think clearly about my situation. My preferred guide is [Alex Vermeer's 8,760 Hours](https://alexvermeer.com/8760hours/), which provides nicely comprehensive prompts across one's life areas.

Lots of things are going well. My kids are thriving, we have a good environment at home. Work is generally rewarding. I've got fairly good habits and I'm continuing to get better at taking care of myself. The one gap is that I am still not writing anywhere near as much as I would like, for the sake of my own creative self-esteem.

I get grand ideas, but I have not got the hang of developing outlines, etc. to express them clearly in the margins of my other obligations. Since other tactics haven't quite helped me crack this nut, I resolve this year to **blog more, but dumber**. Because I can't readily tell the difference between useful editing and self-interference, I'm going to lower the threshold and give that a whirl.
