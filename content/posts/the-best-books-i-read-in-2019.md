This is a list of some of my favorite fiction books that I read in 2019. See previous iteration: [2018]({{< ref "best-books-2018" >}})

**Martha Wells' _The Murderbot Diaries_.** This is an incredibly fun series, both funny and full of poignant moments. The narrator is a cyborg security operative that broke free of its programming and went on aâ€¦ Netflix binge.
- *All Systems Red*
- *Artificial Condition*
- *Rogue Protocol*
- *Exit Strategy*

**Becky Chambers' _Wayfarers_ series.** Character-focused space opera. Heartbreaking and beautiful.
- *The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet*
- *A Closed and Common Orbit*
- *Records of a Spaceborne Few*

***Green Earth*, Kim Stanley Robinson.** I probably wouldn't have read this book if there hadn't been a crazy sale on the Kindle edition while I was reading KSR's Mars trilogy. It's a novel about political and personal response to climate change and exactly what I needed this year.

***State of Wonder* by Ann Patchett and *Unsheltered* by Barbara Kingsolver**. I'd never read either of these writers, but immediately added them to my list after Richard Powers' recommendation in a [New York Times interview](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/books/review/by-the-book-richard-powers.html). They did not disappoint.
