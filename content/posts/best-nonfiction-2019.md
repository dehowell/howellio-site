This is a list of the best non-fiction books I read in 2019. I shared [my fiction list]({{< "the-best-books-i-read-in-2019" >}}) previously, as well as [my 2018 and 2017 favorites]({{< ref="best-books-2018" >}}).

[**_Living With Complexity_. Donald A. Norman.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8295595-living-with-complexity) 

[**_How to Take Smart Notes_. SÃ¶nke Ahrens**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes) This book challenged my note taking habits. Rather than just highlighting and writing in margins, Ahrens convinced me that it's important to put ideas I read in my own words up front. It makes for more effortful reading, but I'm retaining concepts better.

A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History. Manuel DeLanda. This one was a re-read, but it remains one of my all-time favorite books.

[**_Aspiration_. Agnes Callard.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48105571-aspiration) What is it that we are doing when we deliberately try to shape ourselves into a different person? Callard develops a conceptual model for how aspiration differs from ambition and the particular kinds of reasoning we apply in pursuit of changing our values. This is a beautiful and carefully argued book (discussed previously, [on The Marginalia Club](https://themarginaliaclub.substack.com/p/aspiration-and-akrasia)).

[**_The Science of Enlightenment_. Shinzen Young.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40490123-the-science-of-enlightenment).  

[**_Creative Quest_. Questlove.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36260417-creative-quest)

[**_What It Is_. Lynda Barry.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2086132.What_It_Is)

[**_Metaphors We Live By_. George Lakoff.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34459.Metaphors_We_Live_By)

[**_Atomic Habits_. James Clear.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) This is the one book to read on practical behavior change, containing both a clear conceptual model for how habits develop and practical tactics on how to make progress growing the habits you want.

[**_The Secrets of Our Success_. Joseph Henrich.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25761655-the-secret-of-our-success) Found [via the Slate Star Codex review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/).
