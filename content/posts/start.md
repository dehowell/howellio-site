Iâ€™m a software developer, writer, and amateur philosophy nerd.

My background is in experimental nuclear physics and having interests too diverse to tolerate finishing a PhD. Lucky for me, software is a natural home for curious generalists and I learned enough C and Python in grad school to get in the door.

I also have a daily-ish writing practice, [inspired by David MacIver](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html). You can find those posts under the  **[NOTEBOOK](/tag/notebook/) ** tag. These posts tend to be off-the-cuff and represent thinking-in-progress.
