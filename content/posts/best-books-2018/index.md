I was just flipping through my folder of draft posts and came across an unpublished list of my favorite books I read in 2017. I've been intending over the last few weeks of doing the same for 2018, so I'm taking the old draft as a wake-up call. Rather than let my good intentions lay fallow for another year, I'm choosing instead to lower my standards and share the list without much additional commentary:

- _Principles of Product Development Flow_, by Donald Reinertsen.
- _Reasons and Persons_, by Derek Parfit.
- _How Emotions Are Made_, by Lisa Feldman Barrett
- _The Sciences of the Artificial_, by Herbert Simon
- _A New Stoicism_, by Lawrence Becker
- _The Wizard and the Prophet_, by Charles C. Mann.
- _Against Method_, by Paul Feyerabend
- _Midlife_, by Kieran Setiya

And the forgotten list from 2017:

- _Achieving Our Country_, by Richard Rorty.
- _Happy City_, by Charles Montgomery.
- _The Path_, by Michael Puett.
- _Walkaway_, by Cory Doctorow.
- _A Burglar's Guide to the City_, by Geoff Manaugh.
- _I Am a Strange Loop_, by Douglas Hofstadter.
- _The Real World of Technology_, by Ursula M. Franklin.
- _Philosophical Chemistry_, by Manuel DeLanda.
- _Notes on the Synthesis of Form_, by Christopher Alexander.
- _Draft No. 4_, by John McPhee.

I should (and still intend to) write more about at least some of these books. For now, I'll simply observe that — while I chose these books with no particular plan — they do address some common themes: the ethical and social practice of design, the nature of consciousness and subjective experience, decision making, the place of humans within technological systems, what it means to "know", and how we orient ourselves to the past and future. In short, building a good life and finding my place within the world.

Here's to another year of exploring.
