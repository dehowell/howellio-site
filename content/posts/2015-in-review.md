In 2015, I ran 95 times totalling 293.2 miles. I wrote 220,784 words across 308 journal entries. I read 102 books. I practiced mindfulness meditation for 1,471 minutes. I've also had existential freak-outs over feeling too old and tied-down to achieve my goals[^1]. But I consistently made time for the disciplines I value (writing, reading, exercise, meditation), all in the odd corners of my day. Even around the demands of parenting and work, there is enough time to add up to something substantial.

Here's to doing the same in 2016 (and cutting out even more of the low-value bullshit).
