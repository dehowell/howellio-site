Occasionally, someone in my life says to me "You've got to live a little", after 
learning my rationale for never playing the lottery, hearing about how I use Beeminder, that I go to bed pretty early, or that I hardly drink anymore (and that, when I do, I track exactly how much alcohol I drink and rate-limit it with Beeminder). 

The thing I find ironic about the concept of "living a little" is that it seems to be more about giving into a default hedonistic life script than it does about actually embracing what is true and unique about yourself. My favorite hours of the day are between four and six AM, when I have quiet, a cup of coffee, and can read/write/think intensely about what ever floats my boat. Drinking alcohol, for example, interferes with that time. 

For me, instead of living a _little_ by making the default set of hedonistics choices on display in my adjacent culture, **I'd rather live a _lot_ by embracing my own weird intensity.**
