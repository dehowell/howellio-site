- You are not your thoughts.
- The sense that there is a you experiencing your thoughts and perceptions is a kind of thought. That sense is not you.
- What other people think of as you is a physical body - driven by an assemblage of thoughts and sensations - that behaves in consistent and coherent ways, due to biological factors and habits acquired through your history.
- No single aspect of that entity is you. No thought taken on its own is you. You are a nebulous collection of space-time paths and there is no "secret self" running the show.
- There are a set of practices which provide visceral knowledge of the disunity of the self, showing that "you" are the sum of a set of processes that share the same approximate [world line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line).

People sometimes say that Buddhism is a philosophy, not a religion. That's a little unfair: every religion always contains some philosophy. Buddhism is no different. I choose not to embrace the religious metaphysics[^1] that often accompany Buddhism, but I don't need to redefine how anyone else relates to it. There are as many Buddhisms as there are Buddhists[^2], so I'm content to be pragmatic and cherry-pick those aspects which are compatible with modern cognitive science and [philosophical materialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism), without denying Buddhism's status as a religion.

My theoretical perspective has been heavily influenced by [David Chapman](https://meaningness.wordpress.com/), Evan Thompson's [_Waking, Dreaming, Being_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22329411-waking-dreaming-being), and the commentary from Glenn Wallis in the Modern Library's [_The Basic Teachings of the Buddha_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18420201-basic-teachings-of-the-buddha). I believe that the mind is purely physical and is composed of many neural processes that both cooperate and compete. Buddhist philosophy of mind seems to be both compatible with a materialist view and comes paired with useful practices (primarily meditation) to train awareness and equanimity.

I particularly like [Kenneth Folk's](http://kennethfolkdharma.com) framing of meditation and Buddhist practice as building _contemplative fitness_. When I'm practicing consistently[^3], it really does feel like weightlifting for patience. I meditate so that I can be comfortably present with raw reality, accept the disunity of self, and embrace the chaotic interdependence of life.

[^1]:	Reincarnation, for example.

[^2]:	Or more! The same is true of Christianity. Does every Christian consistently hold the exact same set of beliefs continuously throughout their lives? I doubt such a thing is possible for anyone.

[^3]:	I practice vipassana meditation as taught by Henepola Gunaratana in [_Mindfulness in Plain English_](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html), with some influence from the [Vermont Zen Center](http://vermontzen.org/index.html).
