## **_This Life_, Martin Hägglund**
([Amazon][hagglund2019])

## **_Why Are We Yelling?_, Buster Benson**
([Amazon][benson2019]).

## **_What Is Ancient Philosophy?_, Pierre Hadot**
([Amazon][hadot1995]).

## **_The Phenomenon of Life_, Christopher Alexander**
([Amazon][alexander2001]).

## **_Henry David Thoreau: A Life_ Laura Dassow Walls**
([Amazon][walls2017])

Before reading this biography, I had a reductive view of Thoreau as a Diogenes-style character, hurtling insults at us normies from his cabin on Walden Pond. The Thoreau of _Walden_ was a character he invented and the actual person was so much weirder and  interesting than I thought.

## **_Every Tool's a Hammer_, Adam Savage**
([Amazon][savage2019])

I am a sucker for memoirs of production: stories of how creators and artists work. This was an inspiring and fun read, full of ideas about how to build and maintain creative momentum.

## **_The Economy of Cites_, Jane Jacobs**
([Amazon][jacobs1969])

People throw around the word innovation too easily in 2020, but rarely grapple with its real preconditions and unpredictability. Jane Jacobs better than anyone theorizes the potential of accidental discovery within the networks of practical skill and supply chains that make up an economy — including the ways in which inequality and elites sabotage innovation and growth for the sake of clinging to their power.

## **_Pacific Edge_, Kim Stanley Robinson**
([Amazon][robinson1995]).

Ever since [reading _Aurora_]({{< ref "all-our-operations.md" >}}), KSR has become one of my favorite writers. What I love about his work is how his stories one after another urgently grapple with climate change, the crises it brings, and the revival of civil society in response. They aren't dystopias or fever-dream utopias, but rather acts of _imagination_ about how we could proceed. _Pacific Edge_ takes place in a world where Green parties have come to dominate and society has adapted in more sustainable directions. The protagonist is a reluctant small-town councilman, caught up in a struggle to hold true to his values. It's a lovely book about daily life, showing how a just world isn't the deterministic output of a machine, but rather the product of citizens' moral concern working for one another day after day.

## **_Taking Back Philosophy_ Brian W. Van Norden**
([Amazon][vannorden2017])

## **_Deschooling Society_. Ivan Illich**
([Amazon][illich1971])
