Two chapters into James Clear's [_Atomic Habits_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735211299) and I'm already feeling like this is the unified theory of self-improvement. Some fellow [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/ "Beeminder") users and I will be [reading and discussing this book](https://forum.beeminder.com/t/book-club-atomic-habits-by-james-clear/4568 "Beeminder Forum: Book Club on Atomic Habits") over the next couple of months, but I suspect that I'm going to have a hard time pacing myself!

I already tend to be process-oriented rather than goal-oriented, but James Clear brings in another important element: what do your habits mean for your identity?

> Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.

The goal of establishing a new "good" habit isn't to just earn points with the universe. It's to become the kind of person who _consistently_ does that thing and _therefore_ gets the benefits. Not to _try_ and quit smoking, but to be a non-smoker. Reframe every action as a vote for a particular identity[^1], a way of adding evidence that you are the kind of person you want to be.

So taking the time to write, edit, and publish even a trivial note about what's on my mind will be my evidence that I'm a writer.

[^1]:	This goes well with Jack Cheng's ["Habit Fields" at A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/habit-fields): when you take an action in a particular environment, you train yourself to believe that environment is where that kind of thing happens.
