[Factorio](https://factorio.com) has been released. If you were looking for an indie real-time strategy game based around building automated manufacturing systems while under attack by bug-like aliens, this is your opportunity!

I've only played part way through the tutorials, but this is one of the most addictive games I've seen in years. My first exposure to Minecraft may be the last time I get this sucked into a game. If I decide to buy a copy, I'm also certainly going to have to pair with a Beeminder goal to put an upper bound on how much I can play it in a day.
