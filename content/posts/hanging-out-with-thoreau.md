Although I am anxiously awaiting the results of a COVID test and generally feeling exhausted and rough, today was actually good. Sitting out on the back patio in the heat, reading Laura Dassow Walls' wonderful biography _Thoreau: A Life_ kept me distracted from my aches and gave me plenty of reason to keep myself hydrated.

There are worse ways to spend a day.
