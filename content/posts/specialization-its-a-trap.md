Buckminster Fuller, it turns out, is not a great writer. I picked up a copy of _Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth_ recently, because I am having a deep craving for optimistic visions (wonder why?); it definitely has some interesting bits and I am finding it worth my time, but I'm pretty frustrated with his pompous, convoluted phrasing and the ahistorical speculation used to argue his point.

Still, I am trying to read it charitably, as a fable or some kind of foundation myth for switching from a scarcity to abundance mindset.

The ideas that are interesting to me are:

* **Specialization** is a trap.
* We should think of fossil fuels being to technological civilization like the nutrients in a seed: only to be used while getting self-sustaining metabolic processes under way.
* Wealth should be measured in person-days that a particular mode of life can persist.

I think I'm going to leave the second and third aside for today. The second is compelling to me, but I have geek biases I need to be wary of indulging, and I'm still grappling with whether there is a version of the third that can provide an apples-to-apples comparison across sets of common technologies.

Buckminster Fuller thinks that specialization is harmful to adaptability. When you invest in know-how to optimally exploit a particular set of circumstances, you are shit out of luck when those circumstances change and your skill is no longer needed. That is straightforward enough and a good argument for leaving slack in systems and prioritizing life-long learning. But then Fuller also contends that elites in power deliberately incentivize specialization to force dependence… and that starts to seem like some wild ahistoric speculation.

I find it much more likely that the economic needs of people interested in a skill are more easily met when the skill is packaged in a legible discipline, so that social institutions (like academic disciplines) form around a particular skill, and have natural incentives to police the boundary of their domain as a means of reducing cognitive overload.

On an unrelated note, it seems like Bucky may be patient zero for obnoxious business speak.

This was published in 1969. In 2020… if only. If only.
