From Mary Douglas, _Natural Symbols_:

> As a result of definable pressures on home and school, there is an increasing tendency to rear children by personal, elaborated speech code methods. This produces a child acutely sensitive to the feelings of others, and interested in his own internal states. It follows that such an education will predispose a person to ethical preoccupation, for while it opens up his vocabulary of feeling it also denies him any sense of pattern in his social life. He must therefore look for some justification of his existence outside the performance of set rules. He can only find it in good works on behalf of humanity in general or in personal success, or both. Hence the drive towards a purely ethical religion.

This is at the end of a chapter on the use of speech in a culture at large and within a family in the context of raising children. The phrase "personal, elaborated speech code methods" situates social interaction along two dimensions: the personal to positional and the restricted to elaborated.

Personal and positional speech are two ends of a spectrum describing how one instructs or corrects a child's behavior. Personal speech emphasizes cause and effect between behavior and feelings and is reliant on empathy. Positional speech demands conformity to authority and following set cultural patterns.

Restricted speech codes are formulaic, rely on having shared assumptions between speakers, and are mostly used to reinforce existing identities (both cultural and personal). Elaborated speech codes are used to bridge across gaps in assumptions and are used to make the implicit explicit and work out logical consequences.

Indeed, in my professional experience, knowledge workers are generally expected to be skilled at personal, elaborated speech in order to be successful — certainly so if they have any desire to take on leadership or management positions.

My childhood was definitely dominated by elaborated speech and somewhere in the middle of the personal-positional axis. I've warmed up quite a bit towards more traditional, formal religion as I've gotten older, but I do have—as Mary Douglas describes—a strong drive towards "purely ethical religion".

There is an irony here: success at information economy jobs demands that one develop an orientation towards the world that, if pursued rigorously, makes the immoral consequences of those same jobs more emotionally painful. If there is a strong feedback loop from private moral conflict to company policy, this would be a good thing.

Of course, we won't all agree on which actions are immoral, especially where what I consider immoral behavior is both legal and profitable. When morality requires taking on costs to correct negative externalities, conflict will tend to resolve in favor of those with more limited senses of ethical obligations and management will be incentivized to wield its power to suppress internal dissent. Look [at how Google has retaliated against employees who have organized walkouts](https://www.wired.com/story/google-walkout-organizers-say-theyre-facing-retaliation/) over ethical concerns.

We cannot live by our ethics when they are treated as purely private concerns, because our acts in public and in our jobs are the most consequential ethical realms in our lives.
